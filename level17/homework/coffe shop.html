It was introduced to Italian restaurants in the United States as early as the 1930s, but it was not until the 1980s that the drink became widespread with the rise of nationwide coffee chains.</p></div>

Interestingly, American soldiers stationed in Italy didn't care for the very strong espresso that was favoured in the country, therefore they tried to recreate their beloved drip coffee from back home by adding water to the espresso shot.</p></div>

In northern Europe and Scandinavia, a similar "trend" started in the early 1980s as caf√© au lait became popular again, prepared with espresso and steamed milk.</p></div>
