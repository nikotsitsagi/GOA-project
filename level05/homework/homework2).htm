<h1>programming languages</h1>


<h3>there are many types of programming languages. but today i will showcase only 5 of them</h3>




<h1>1# Python<h3>
     <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>
     <h3>here is the logo of python and the example of its coding design</h3>

    <img src = "./images/download.jpeg" width = 15%>                        <img src = "./images/image-4.png" width = 20%> <button>coding example</button>


<h1>2# Javascript<h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</p>
    <h3>here is the logo of javascript and the example of its coding design</h3>
    <button> the logo</button>                                                    
    <img src = "./images/download (1).jpeg" width = 20%>                        <img src = "./images/tkreum32180p4isvy5cb.png" width = 20%> <button>coding example</button>
 
<h1>3# C++<h3>
    <p>C++ is a generic programming language for building software. It's an object-oriented language. In other words, it emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (a.k.a. objects) rather than logic or functions. A common example of an object is a user account on a website.</p>

<h1>4# Java<h3> (fun fact, minecraft was actually made by java)
    <p>Java is an extremely transferable programming language used across platforms and different types of devices, from smartphones to smart TVs. It's used for creating mobile and web apps, enterprise software, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, gaming, big data, distributed, and cloud-based applications among other types.</p>
